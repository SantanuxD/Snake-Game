# SnakegamebySantanu 🐍🎮

***

Tried designing the old classic **snake game** using turtle module in python 🐢

Turtle is a pre-installed Python library that enables users to create pictures and shapes by providing them with a virtual canvas. The onscreen pen that you use for drawing is called the turtle and this is what gives the library its name. In short, the Python turtle library helps new programmers get a feel for what programming with Python is like in a fun and interactive way.

Turtle is mainly used to introduce children to the world of computers. It’s a straightforward yet versatile way to understand the concepts of Python. This makes it a great avenue for kids to take their first steps in Python programming. That being said, the Python turtle library is not restricted to little ones alone! It’s also proved extremely useful for adults who are trying their hands at Python, which makes it great for Python beginners.

With the Python **turtle library**, you can draw and create various types of shapes and images.
